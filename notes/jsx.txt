html class attribute:
    className in jsx

To embed a JS expression in JSX (in html), use curly braces:
    <span>{x}</span>
    <span>{3}</span>
    <span>{3 + 3}</span>
    <span>{p.firstName}</span>
    <span> {3 > 10} </span>           will render nothing
    <span>{String(3 > 10)}</span>
    <span>{3 < 10}</span>

    Normally js expressions to be rendered should resolve to:
        a string
        a number
        a js expression that returns null or false will not be rendered
            <span> {3 > 10} </span> renders <span>  </span>
        curly js expressions are not only used to render something
            they are also used in attribute values
            in that case a false or null may be more appropriate

inline style:
    <div style={ { } } />
    in html style attribute is a string
    in jsx style property is:
        an object of type CSSProperties
        css properties are js properties
        css property names are camelCase
        why do we need to curlies:
            Outer curlies: {  }
                jsx: js expression inside
            Inner curlies:
                js: js object literal
